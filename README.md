# Virtual TA Project Team4

This project was made for CS4485 Senior Design Project so some of this readme will talk about the virtual machine. This project is creating a bot that can answer questions a TA could from the class Advanced Algorithms and Data Structure. This project incorporate:

* A front end website component created in React.js
* API/Routing Server created in Express.js
* A chat bot created through the Rasa Framework
* MongoDB database to store relevant information

The only part of the project that has not been included is the MongoDB database

Questions that you can query the chat bot:

 * Algorithms
     * Ask running times of algorithm
     * Compare two algorithms
     * Ask the what
 *
